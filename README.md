## Overview
For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I had to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I had taken a static design that lacks accessibility and I had to convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I had to also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.
